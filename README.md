# Final Project for UIUC CS598 DLH

Today abundant health data such as electronic health records (EHR) supports the development of better computational models. Deep learning methods have been widely utilized to design medication recommendation algorithms but none of them considers the adverse drug-drug interactions (DDI). 

For our final project in CS598 Deep Learning in Healthcare, we attempted to reproduce the research paper titled "GAMENet: Graph Augmented MEmory Networks for Recommending Medication Combination", which proposed the Graph Augmented Memory Networks (GAMENet) to fill this gap. This deep learning model takes both longitudinal patient EHR data and DDIs based knowledge as inputs and outputs recommendation of medication combinations.

### The code folder contains the following scripts:
 - util.py - Helper functions used in the models.
 - layers.py - Simple GCN layer.
 - models.py - Deep learning models.
 - constants.py - Parameters used in the models.
 - preprocessing.py - Data preprocessing.
 - baseline_near.py - Recommend the same combination medications at previous visit for current visit.
 - train_LR.py - Use a logistic regression with L2 regularization to make the predictions.
 - train_Retain.py - A two-level neural attention model which detects influential past visits and significant clinical variables within those visits. 
 - train_Leap.py - Leap formulates a multi-instance multi-label learning framework and proposes a variant of sequence-to-sequence model based on content-attention mechanism to predict combination of medicines given patientâ€™s diagnoses.
 - train_GAMENet.py - Integrates the drug-drug interactions knowledge graph by a memory module implemented as a graph convolutional networks, and models longitudinal patient records as the query.
